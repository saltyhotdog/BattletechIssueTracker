### HELP NEEDED: A request for community help with a technical project

Requests for help must clearly define what help is needed, why it is needed, and what anyone who helps must do to resolve the issue.

## Process

### 1. Clearly define your issue

The number one objective of this issue tracker is clarity.

Ensure that your issue can be clearly categorized into one of the above issue classifications.

### 2. Open an issue with the appropriate tag

Choose the tag that best fits your issue.

Provide all details required for your issue to meet the DEFINITION OF READY.

If your issue does not meet the definition of ready an admin may tag your issue with "Needs Work." After tagging your issue the admin must leave a clear explanation of what is needed for the issue to reach definition of ready.

Admins may close issues at this point if they're duplicates, miscategorized, or aren't appropriate for this tracker.

# Creating Issues for HBS Input

Our goal is to create a clear and expected framework to most effectively communicate with HBS developers. This will enable the community to interact with the development team in a more structured way 

This framework may appear rigid, but it is created with the intent to establish clear expectations and clarity in communication to the HBS dev team. This minimizes the chances of miscommunication and allows for a clear understanding of process between all involved parties.

## Definition of Actionable

* There must be a clearly stated problem and a clearly stated example of the problem.
* If the problem is reproducable, there must be clear instructions on how to reproduce it.

* The issue must be able to be categorized in one of the following severities.
