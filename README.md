# Creating Issues for Modder Input

# Creating Issues for HBS Input

Our goal is to create a clear and expected framework to most effectively communicate with HBS developers. This will enable the community to interact with the development team in a more structured way 

This framework may appear rigid, but it is created with the intent to establish clear expectations and clarity in communication to the HBS dev team. This minimizes the chances of miscommunication and allows for a clear understanding of process between all involved parties.

## Definition of Actionable
